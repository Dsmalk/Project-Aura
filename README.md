# Project-Aura
This repository contains all the documentation developed throughout the AURA project ‚Äî a training-based initiative completed during my time at Foo Talent Group, focused on practical QA and software validation.

‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up: The current content is in Spanish and still under revision. I‚Äôm working on translating the final QA report into English for broader accessibility.

## üìö Summary

I joined the **AURA project** from its initial stage, taking on the role of **QA Leader**. From the beginning, I was responsible for coordinating the testing efforts, reporting progress, and documenting every relevant finding during the early development phases.

At first, I was the only QA on the team, which meant I handled all functional validations, bug tracking, and reporting processes. As the project evolved, three more QA members joined to support the work, and I led their onboarding and testing coordination.

**AURA** is a medical web application designed to streamline operations in therapy centers and improve professional-patient management.

Throughout the project, I was actively involved in:

- üîÑ Daily syncs with the development and design teams.
- ‚úÖ Functional testing and bug reporting in each sprint.
- üß™ Writing, executing, and maintaining test cases.
- üìà Weekly QA reviews with the PM and stakeholders.
- ü§ù Leading QA meetings and organizing the team's tasks.

The documents and reports in this repository reflect the validation work carried out during that process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used

Throughout the AURA project, I worked with a variety of tools that supported the QA process, test automation, documentation, and collaboration:

- **Postman** ‚Äì For testing REST APIs and validating backend responses.
- **Git** ‚Äì Version control system to manage changes and track progress across the project.
- **Swagger** ‚Äì To explore and understand the available API endpoints.
- **ChatGPT** ‚Äì Used as a support tool for generating ideas, test scenarios, and clarifying technical concepts.
- **Loom** ‚Äì To record and share visual evidence of bugs, flows, and functionality during testing.
- **ClickUp** ‚Äì Project management platform used to track tasks, bugs, and sprint planning.
- **JMeter** *(planned)* ‚Äì To be used for performance and load testing of key endpoints.

## üß™ Test Cases

Here you can find a set of test cases created as part of the QA process for the AURA project. The documents include validations for both Frontend and Backend features, as well as API endpoint-specific tests and regression scenarios.

##  Achievements during this Project

- Successfully adapted to the project context from the early stages, assuming full responsibility for QA coordination in an evolving development environment.

- Identified and reported key issues in the API, including **incorrectly implemented endpoints** that led to critical failures.
  
- Maintained clear documentation and structured communication with the team, which supported faster debugging and resolution cycles throughout the QA process.
