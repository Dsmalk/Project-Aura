# Project-Aura
This repository contains all the documentation developed throughout the AURA project — a training-based initiative completed during my time at Foo Talent Group, focused on practical QA and software validation.

⚠️ Heads up: The current content is in Spanish and still under revision. I’m working on translating the final QA report into English for broader accessibility.
